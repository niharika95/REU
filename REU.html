			<div class="objectivesIntellectualmeritBroaderImpactsContent">
				<p>The objectives of the proposed REU site is to involve undergraduate students in quality research experiences in the exciting field of software engineering, hence to retain undergraduate students in engineering and to increase recruitment of students into graduate programs. Building on the research of an experienced team of faculty mentors, the program focuses on three main themes covering the entire software development life cycle: Developers’ Productivity, Communication and Collaboration, and Design and Creativity. The proposed comprehensive academic program touches all components of an REU site from introductory workshops to the preparation of the final research reports that could lead to publications. A nationwide recruitment process is used to select cohorts of undergraduate students to participate in a ten-week summer research program at the host institution. The goal is to target first generation, underrepresented minorities, women and persons with disabilities, and provide opportunities for students from schools with limited research opportunities. The project includes mentoring by the experienced faculty members, technical seminars and workshops, student presentations, field trips and other professional development opportunities.</p>

			<div class="objectivesIntellectualmeritBroaderImpactsContent">
				<p>Software systems have become the critical infrastructure of the modern society. This project will make a meaningful impact in how to develop better software systems in enhancing our quality of life and the social welfare. It is imperative that we provide a larger pool of individuals trained in the field of software engineering to address the increasing national needs. Through this project, we will able to provide opportunities to a diverse group of undergraduates, many from predominantly undergraduate institutions, to spend a summer in a research intensive department. Our model for REU will be disseminated within our institution and among other institutions.</p>

He has extensive experience in the area of software architecture design and related concepts (Santos et al., 2017; Mirakhorli and Cleland-Huang, 2016; Rahimi et al., 2014), including topics such as software architecture recovery (Mirakhorli et al., 2012; Kouroshfar et al., 2015; Mujhid et al., 2017; Mirakhorli, 2015), architecture tooling and technology transfer (Mirakhorli et al., 2014; Cleland-Huang et al., 2013), architecture traceability (Mirakhorli and Cleland-Huang, 2011; Zogaan et al., 2017), recommender systems (Hariri et al., 2013) and the adaption of data mining and information retrieval techniques to solve software engineering problems (Gopalakrishnan et al., 2017). His work has received best paper awards at several prestigious conferences such as ICSA and ICSE. Dr. Mirakhorli currently supervises three Ph.D. students, two of which are female (Joanna Cecilia Da Silva Santos and Danielle Gonzalez). He has hired several female undergraduates and graduate research assistants (Palak Sharma, Adriana Sejfia, Heena Farhat, Jodie Miu, Taylor Corrello). He has previously used NSF REU and other funding opportunities to engage several undergraduate students, including a student of color (Steven Simmons), and one student who is hard of hearing (John Rivera). PI Mirakhorli has published several research papers with undergraduates e.g., Zogaan et al. (2017); Gonzalez et al. (2017) and several of his students, including women and minorities, transitioning to Ph.D. programs. Danielle Gonzalez, a Hispanic-American student who was previously working as an undergraduate student on the PI’s NSF EAGER grant, has joined RIT’s Ph.D. program in 2016. Through this REU Site, undergraduate students will have an opportunity to work in a diverse and inclusive research environment, interact with PIs’ Ph.D. students and other research assistants and learn from their personal experience.</p>

				<div class="profContentSection">
					<p>Dr. Yi Wang is an assistant professor in the Department of Software Engineering at the Rochester Institute of Technology. Before joining RIT in 2017, he was a research staff member in IBM research-Almaden. He received Ph.D. in Information and Computer Science (2015) from University of California, Irvine. Dr. Wang is one the pioneers who introduce game theory as an analytical framework to study collaboration dynamics in software engineering team. Dr. Wang’s research interest lies in the complex dynamics of collaboration in Software Engineering teams. Currently, his research focuses on three major themes: investigating and modeling the interpersonal interactions in software engineering team using game theory and other social/behavioral theories; developing theory-inspired, data-driven analytics for collaboration in teams, and building tools to support the analytics. He has published over 30 refereed papers in journals and conferences, including premier software engineering, computer-supported collaborative work, and social computing venues such as ICSE, ESEM, CSCW, GROUP, HT, etc. Dr. Wang has worked with many undergraduates. Recently, Dr. Wang introduces a new undergraduate course: “Engineering Cloud Based Software Systems” in which he teaches how to build, deploy, and manage cloud based big data applications. Dr. Wang also works with undergraduates to mentor their senior projects. Dr. Wang proactively involves in promoting the participation of underrepresented groups. For instance, he mentored female and African American students in a senior project that just concluded in summer 2017. He has published a refereed paper with undergraduate students. Dr. Wang will be the leading mentor for the REU projects related to communication and collaboration.</p>
